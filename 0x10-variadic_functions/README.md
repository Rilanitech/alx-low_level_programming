Variadic function is a function of indefinite arity, i.e., one which accepts a variable number of arguments
In functional languages variadics can be considered complementary to the apply function, which takes a function and a list/sequence/array as arguments, and calls the function with the arguments supplied in that list, thus passing a variable number of arguments to the function.
